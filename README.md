Based on the above plot, the most impactful features are 'Outlet_Identifier_OUT049', 'Outlet_Identifier_OUT035', and 'Outlet_Size'. What this means is that for every 1 point increase in 'Outlet_Size', the predicted sales price decreases by -1.377442e+14. For every 1 point increase in 'Outlet_Identifier_OUT035', the sales price decreases by -7.648520e+13. Lastly, for every 1 point increase in 'Outlet_Identifier_OUT049', the predicted sales price increases by 8.359209e+13.
